# CSUSB-Qtr-to-Semi-Calculator
A webform created using HTML and JavaScript while I was working at CSUSB as a Student Web Developer. Users use the form to calculate the unit conversions between Quarter Units and Semester Units. Users also can determine how many more quarter and semester units are need to graduate.
